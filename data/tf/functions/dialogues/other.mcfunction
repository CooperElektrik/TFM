data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line4 set value "Even though you knew involving yourself would bring nothing but trouble..."
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line5 set value "I wonder if it's just in a doctor's nature."
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line6 set value "I apologize that I left at that time without thanking you properly."
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line7 set value "I happened to be nearby, so I thought I'd come to give my thanks."
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line8 set value "Oh no, I'm fine. I don't plan to take too much of your time."
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line9 set value "For now, please accept this..." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line10 set value "My payment was delayed until now, so please consider it as an apology."

data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line15 set value "...Hey, come over here." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line16 set value "A wealthy person died in an accident recently." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line17 set value "He didn't have any close relatives, so people claiming to be government officials, relatives, and friends came and stole all of his assets." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line18 set value "I have a few connections here and there so I was able to get some of the leftovers, but I was also entrusted with a few troublesome items." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line19 set value "Yes, this one here is one of them." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line20 set value "I am but a humble merchant now, and my motto is to buy and sell anything, so I was told to sell this off somehow, but..." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line21 set value "When it comes to buying and selling people, it'd be fine if the one in question could be used for manual labor, but it's not easy finding a buyer for a brat like this." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line22 set value "If I rush things, there is a possibility that I may suffer some losses too." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line23 set value "It's not like I need to break even on this one, so rather than doing something stupid, I thought of either disposing of her or throwing her away, but..." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line24 set value "Even I have some conscience and compassion." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line25 set value "I want to avoid anything troublesome, but I didn't have anywhere I could hand this one off to." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line26 set value "I was doing business in this town, and then I remembered that you had saved my life once before." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line27 set value "From what I can tell it seems that you are still living by yourself,"
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line28 set value "and it may be none of my business, but I thought that you may be feeling a bit lonely..." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line29 set value "It's a bit sudden, but would you take this one in?" 

data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line30 set value "I see." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line31 set value "Well, it was sudden so I guess it can't be helped." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line32 set value "Thank you for your time." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line33 set value "I shall take my leave." 

data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line34 set value "Is that so! It'll help both me and this girl out." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line35 set value "This girl is a slave without any relatives." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line36 set value "You can have her help around the house, or if you have such preferences you can treat her like your toy." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line38 set value "There is no one who would object." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line39 set value "If you want to know more about her, you can ask her." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line40 set value "Then, I shall take my leave." 
data modify storage tf:dialogue.other intro.line41 set value "Once again, thank you very much for saving me that day."
